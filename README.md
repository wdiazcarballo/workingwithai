Here's a tutorial to upgrade the quality of the provided code to demonstrate the properties of RESTful APIs:

### Weak Points of the Existing Code:

1. **Lack of Authentication and Authorization:** The code lacks proper authentication and authorization mechanisms, which are crucial for security.
2. **Inconsistent Error Handling:** Error handling is not consistent across different endpoints.
3. **Hardcoded Values:** The code contains hardcoded values, such as the JWT secret and database connection string, which should be managed using environment variables for security and flexibility.
4. **Lack of Input Validation:** There is no input validation in the controllers, which can lead to security vulnerabilities.
5. **Code Duplication:** There is duplication in the middleware for logging requests, which can be abstracted into a separate function.

### Upgrading Code Quality:

1. **Implement Proper Authentication and Authorization:**
   - Use Passport.js with JWT strategy for authentication.
   - Implement role-based authorization to restrict access to certain endpoints.

2. **Standardize Error Handling:**
   - Create a custom error class and middleware to handle different types of errors consistently.

3. **Use Environment Variables:**
   - Store sensitive information and configurations in environment variables using a library like `dotenv`.

4. **Add Input Validation:**
   - Use a library like `express-validator` to validate and sanitize input data in the controllers.

5. **Refactor Code to Reduce Duplication:**
   - Abstract the logging middleware into a separate function and use it across all routes.

### Analysis of RESTful API Properties:

| Property        | Original Code                       | Upgraded Code                         |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Performance     | Good, but can be improved with better error handling and input validation. | Improved with optimized error handling and input validation. |
| Scalability     | Limited due to hardcoded values and lack of proper authentication. | Enhanced with environment variables and robust authentication. |
| Simplicity      | Moderate, with some code duplication and inconsistent error handling. | Improved with refactored code and standardized error handling. |
| Modifiability   | Limited due to hardcoded values and lack of input validation. | Enhanced with environment variables and input validation. |
| Visibility      | Limited due to inconsistent error handling and lack of proper logging. | Improved with standardized error handling and logging middleware. |
| Portability     | Limited due to hardcoded database connection string. | Enhanced with environment variables for configuration. |
| Reliability     | Good, but can be improved with better error handling and authentication. | Improved with robust error handling and authentication mechanisms. |

By following this tutorial, students can transform the provided code into a more professional and RESTful API, demonstrating improved performance, scalability, simplicity, modifiability, visibility, portability, and reliability.
